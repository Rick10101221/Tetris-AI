# tetris_ai
A tetris game that I will hopefully integrate with AI so that I don't have to play it myself! Mainly meant so that I can step out of my comfort zone and learn about new python libraries and computer software.


Note: The code is NOT MINE. I am following this video tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfvxp7PgQ6c. All credit goes to freeCodeCamp.org.
