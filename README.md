# Tetris AI Description
A tetris game that I will hopefully integrate with AI so that I don't have to play it myself! Mainly meant so that I can step out of my comfort zone and learn how to develop Python games and the pygame library.

# Update
Still have plans to integrate it with ML. Have yet to learn about ML because I'm focusing on HTML/CSS/JS, then MERN, then AI.

# Note
The code is NOT MINE. I am following this video tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfvxp7PgQ6c. All credit goes to freeCodeCamp.org.
